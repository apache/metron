# Metron Profiler Client

This project provides a client API for accessing the profiles generated by the [Metron Profiler](../metron-profiler).  This includes both a Java API and Stellar API for accessing the profile data.  The primary use case is to extract profile data for use during model scoring.

## Stellar Client API

### `PROFILE_GET`

The `PROFILE_GET` command allows you to select all of the profile measurements written.  This command takes the following arguments:
```
REQUIRED:
    profile - The name of the profile
    entity - The name of the entity
    periods - The list of profile periods to grab.  These are ProfilePeriod objects.
OPTIONAL:
	groups_list - Optional, must correspond to the 'groupBy' list used in profile creation - List (in square brackets) of 
            groupBy values used to filter the profile. Default is the empty list, meaning groupBy was not used when 
            creating the profile.
    config_overrides - Optional - Map (in curly braces) of name:value pairs, each overriding the global config parameter
            of the same name. Default is the empty Map, meaning no overrides.
```
There is an older calling format where `groups_list` is specified as a sequence of group names, "varargs" style, instead of a List object.  This format is still supported for backward compatibility, but it is deprecated, and it is disallowed if the optional `config_overrides` argument is used.

The `periods` field is (likely) the output of another Stellar function which defines the times to include.

#### Groups_list argument
The `groups_list` argument in the client must exactly correspond to the [`groupBy`](../metron-profiler#groupby) configuration in the profile definition.  If `groupBy` was not used in the profile, `groups_list` must be empty in the client.  If `groupBy` was used in the profile, then the client `groups_list` is <b>not</b> optional; it must be the same length as the `groupBy` list, and specify exactly one selected group value for each `groupBy` criterion, in the same order.  For example:
```
If in Profile, the groupBy criteria are:  [ “DAY_OF_WEEK()”, “URL_TO_PORT()” ]
Then in PROFILE_GET, an allowed groups value would be:  [ “3”, “8080” ]
which will select only records from Tuesdays with port number 8080.
```

#### Configuration and the config_overrides argument

By default, the Profiler creates profiles with a period duration of 15 minutes. This means that data is accumulated, summarized and flushed every 15 minutes. 
The Client API must also have knowledge of this duration to correctly retrieve the profile data. If the Client is expecting 15 minute periods, it will not be 
able to read data generated by a Profiler that was configured for 1 hour periods, and will return zero results.  

Similarly, all six Client configuration parameters listed in the table below must match the Profiler configuration parameter settings from the time the profile 
was created. The period duration and other configuration parameters from the Profiler topology are stored in local filesystem at `$METRON_HOME/config/profiler.properties`. 
The Stellar Client API can be configured correspondingly by setting the following properties in Metron's global configuration, on local filesystem at
`$METRON_HOME/config/zookeeper/global.json`, then uploaded to Zookeeper (at `/metron/topology/global`) by using `zk_load_configs.sh`: 

    ```
    $ cd $METRON_HOME
    $ bin/zk_load_configs.sh -m PUSH -i config/zookeeper/ -z node1:2181
    ```

Any of these six Client configuration parameters may be overridden at run time using the `config_overrides` Map argument in PROFILE_GET. The primary use case is 
when historical profiles have been created with a different Profiler configuration than is currently configured, and the analyst needing to access them does not 
want to change the global Client configuration so as not to disrupt the work of other analysts working with current profiles.

| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| profiler.client.period.duration       | The duration of each profile period.  This value should be defined along with `profiler.client.period.duration.units`.             | Optional | 15       |
| profiler.client.period.duration.units | The units used to specify the profile period duration.  This value should be defined along with `profiler.client.period.duration`. | Optional | MINUTES  |
| profiler.client.hbase.table           | The name of the HBase table used to store profile data.                                                                            | Optional | profiler |
| profiler.client.hbase.column.family   | The name of the HBase column family used to store profile data.                                                                    | Optional | P        |
| profiler.client.salt.divisor          | The salt divisor used to store profile data.                                                                                       | Optional | 1000     |
| hbase.provider.impl                   | The name of the HBaseTableProvider implementation class.                                                                           | Optional |          |


### Profile Selectors

You will notice that the third argument for `PROFILE_GET` is a list of `ProfilePeriod` objects.  This list is expected to
be produced by another Stellar function.  There are a couple options available.

#### `PROFILE_FIXED`

The profiler periods associated with a fixed lookback starting from now.  These are ProfilePeriod objects.
```
REQUIRED:
    durationAgo - How long ago should values be retrieved from?
    units - The units of 'durationAgo'.
OPTIONAL:
    config_overrides - Optional - Map (in curly braces) of name:value pairs, each overriding the global config parameter
            of the same name. Default is the empty Map, meaning no overrides.

e.g. To retrieve all the profiles for the last 5 hours.  PROFILE_GET('profile', 'entity', PROFILE_FIXED(5, 'HOURS'))
```

Note that the `config_overrides` parameter operates exactly as the `config_overrides` argument in `PROFILE_GET`.
The only available parameters for override are:
* `profiler.client.period.duration` 
* `profiler.client.period.duration.units`

#### `PROFILE_WINDOW`

`PROFILE_WINDOW` is intended to provide a finer-level of control over selecting windows for profiles:
* Specify windows relative to the data timestamp (see the optional `now` parameter below)
* Specify non-contiguous windows to better handle seasonal data (e.g. the last hour for every day for the last month)
* Specify profile output excluding holidays
* Specify only profile output on a specific day of the week

It does this by a domain specific language mimicking natural language that defines the windows excluded.

```
REQUIRED:
    windowSelector - The statement specifying the window to select.
    now - Optional - The timestamp to use for now.
OPTIONAL:
    config_overrides - Optional - Map (in curly braces) of name:value pairs, each overriding the global config parameter
            of the same name. Default is the empty Map, meaning no overrides.

e.g. To retrieve all the measurements written for 'profile' and 'entity' for the last hour 
on the same weekday excluding weekends and US holidays across the last 14 days: 
PROFILE_GET('profile', 'entity', PROFILE_WINDOW('1 hour window every 24 hours starting from 14 days ago including the current day of the week excluding weekends, holidays:us'))
```

Note that the `config_overrides` parameter operates exactly as the `config_overrides` argument in `PROFILE_GET`.
The only available parameters for override are:
* `profiler.client.period.duration`
* `profiler.client.period.duration.units`

##### The Profile Selector Language

The domain specific language can be broken into a series of clauses, some optional
* <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:blue">Total Temporal Duration</span></a> - The total range of time in which windows may be specified
* <a href="#InclusionExclusion_specifiers"><span style="color:red">Temporal Window Width</span></a> - How large each temporal window
* <a href="#Skip_distance"><span style="color:green">Skip distance</span></a> (optional)- How far to skip between when one window starts and when the next begins
* <a href="#InclusionExclusion_specifiers"><span style="color:purple">Inclusion/Exclusion specifiers</span></a> (optional) - The set of specifiers to further filter the window

One *must* specify either a total temporal duration or a temporal window width.
The remaining clauses are optional.
During the course of the following discussion, we will color code the clauses in the examples and link them
to the relevant section for more detail.

From a high level, the language fits the following three forms, which are composed of the clauses above:

* <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">time_interval WINDOW?</span></a>  <a href="#InclusionExclusion_specifiers"><span style="color:purple">(INCLUDING specifier_list)? (EXCLUDING specifier_list)?</span></a>
* <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">time_interval WINDOW?</span></a> <a href="#Skip_distance"><span style="color:green">EVERY time_interval</span></a> <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">FROM time_interval (TO time_interval)?</span></a> <a href="#InclusionExclusion_specifiers"><span style="color:purple">(INCLUDING specifier_list)? (EXCLUDING specifier_list)?</span></a>
* <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">FROM time_interval (TO time_interval)?</span></a>


###### <span style="color:blue">Total Temporal Duration</span>

Total temporal duration is specified by a phrase: `FROM time_interval AGO TO time_interval AGO`
This indicates the beginning and ending of a time interval.  This is an inclusive duration.
* `FROM` - Can be the words "from" or "starting from"
* `time_interval` - A time amount followed by a unit (e.g. 1 hour). Fractional amounts are not supported. The unit may be "minute", "day", "hour" with any pluralization.
* `TO` - Can be the words "until" or "to"
* `AGO` - Optionally the word "ago"

The `TO time_interval AGO` portion is optional.  If unspecified then it is expected that the time interval ends now.

Due to the vagaries of the english language, the from and the to portions, if both specified, are interchangeable
with regard to which one specifies the start and which specifies the end.  

In other words "<a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">starting from 1 hour ago to 30 minutes ago</span></a>" and
"<a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">starting from 30 minutes ago to 1 hour ago</span></a>" specify the same
temporal duration.

**Examples**

* A duration starting 1 hour ago and ending now
   * <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">from 1 hour ago</span></a>
   * <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">from 1 hour</span></a>
   * <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">starting from 1 hour ago</span></a>
   * <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">starting from 1 hour</span></a>
* A duration starting 1 hour ago and ending 30 minutes ago: 
   * <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">from 1 hour ago until 30 minutes ago</span></a>
   * <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">from 30 minutes ago until 1 hour ago</span></a>
   * <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">starting from 1 hour ago to 30 minutes ago</span></a>
   * <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">starting from 1 hour to 30 minutes</span></a>

###### <span style="color:red">Temporal Window Width</span>

Temporal window width is the specification of a window. 
A window is may either repeat within total temporal duration or may fill the total temporal duration.  This is an inclusive window.
A window is specified by the phrase: `time_interval WINDOW`
* `time_interval` - A time amount followed by a unit (e.g. 1 hour).  Fractional amounts are not supported. The unit may be "minute", "day", "hour" with any pluralization.
* `WINDOW` - Optionally the word "window"

**Examples**

* A fixed window starting 2 hours ago and going until now
  * <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">2 hour</span></a>
  * <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">2 hours</span></a>
  * <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">2 hours window</span></a>
* A repeating 30 minute window starting 2 hours ago and repeating every hour until now.
This would result in 2 30-minute wide windows: 2 hours ago and 1 hour ago
  * <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">30 minute window</span></a> <a href="#Skip_distance"><span style="color:green">every 1 hour</span></a> <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">starting from 2 hours ago</span></a>
  * <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">30 minute windows</span></a> <a href="#Skip_distance"><span style="color:green">every 1 hour</span></a> <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">from 2 hours ago</span></a>
* A repeating 30 minute window starting 2 hours ago and repeating every hour until 30 minutes ago.
This would result in 2 30-minute wide windows: 2 hours ago and 1 hour ago
  * <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">30 minute window</span></a> <a href="#Skip_distance"><span style="color:green">every 1 hour</span></a> <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">starting from 2 hours ago until 30 minutes ago</span></a>
  * <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">30 minutes window</span></a> <a href="#Skip_distance"><span style="color:green">every 1 hour</span></a> <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">from 2 hours ago to 30 minutes ago</span></a>
  * <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">30 minutes window</span></a> <a href="#Skip_distance"><span style="color:green">for every 1 hour</span></a> <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">from 30 minutes ago to 2 hours ago</span></a>

###### <span style="color:green">Skip distance</span>

Skip distance is the amount of time between temporal window beginnings that the next window starts.
It is, in effect, the window period.  

It is specified by the phrase `EVERY time_interval`
* `time_interval` - A time amount followed by a unit (e.g. 1 hour).  Fractional amounts are not supported. The unit may be "minute", "day", "hour" with any pluralization. 
* `EVERY` - The word/phrase "every" or "for every"

**Examples**

* A repeating 30 minute window starting 2 hours ago and repeating every hour until now.
This would result in 2 30-minute wide windows: 2 hours ago and 1 hour ago
  * <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">30 minute window</span></a> <a href="#Skip_distance"><span style="color:green">every 1 hour</span></a> <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">starting from 2 hours ago </span></a>
  * <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">30 minutes window</span></a> <a href="#Skip_distance"><span style="color:green">every 1 hour</span></a> <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">from 2 hours ago </span></a>
* A repeating 30 minute window starting 2 hours ago and repeating every hour until 30 minutes ago.
This would result in 2 30-minute wide windows: 2 hours ago and 1 hour ago
  * <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">30 minute window</span></a> <a href="#Skip_distance"><span style="color:green">every 1 hour</span></a> <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">starting from 2 hours ago until 30 minutes ago</span></a>
  * <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">30 minutes window</span></a> <a href="#Skip_distance"><span style="color:green">every 1 hour</span></a> <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">from 2 hours ago to 30 minutes ago</span></a>
  * <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">30 minutes window</span></a> <a href="#Skip_distance"><span style="color:green">for every 1 hour</span></a> <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">from 30 minutes ago to 2 hours ago</span></a>

###### <span style="color:purple">Inclusion/Exclusion specifiers</span>
Inclusion and Exclusion specifiers operate as filters on the set of windows.
They operate on the window beginning timestamp.

For inclusion specifiers, windows who are passed by _any_ of the set of inclusion specifiers are included.  
inclusion specifiers. Similarly, windows who are passed by _any_ of the set of exclusion specifiers are excluded.
Exclusion specifiers trump inclusion specifiers.

Specifiers follow one of the following formats depending on if it is an inclusion or exclusion specifier:
* `INCLUSION specifier, specifier, ...`
  * `INCLUSION` can be "include", "includes" or "including"
* `EXCLUSION specifier, specifier, ...`
  * `EXCLUSION` can be "exclude", "excludes" or "excluding"


The specifiers are a set of fixed specifiers available as part of the language:
* Fixed day of week-based specifiers - includes or excludes if the window is on the specified day of the week
  * "monday" or "mondays"
  * "tuesday" or "tuesdays"
  * "wednesday" or "wednesdays"
  * "thursday" or "thursdays"
  * "friday" or "fridays"
  * "saturday" or "saturdays"
  * "sunday" or "sundays"
  * "weekday" or "weekdays"
  * "weekend" or ""weekends"
* Relative day of week-based specifiers - includes or excludes based on the day of week relative to now
  * "current day of the week"
  * "current day of week"
  * "this day of the week"
  * "this day of week" 
* Specified date - includes or excludes based on the specified date
  * "date" - Takes up to 2 arguments
    * The day in `yyyy/MM/dd` format if no second argument is provided
    * Optionally the format to specify the first argument in
    * Example: `date:2017/12/25` would include or exclude December 25, 2017
    * Example: `date:20171225:yyyyMMdd` would include or exclude December 25, 2017
* Holidays - includes or excludes based on if the window starts during a holiday
  * "holiday" or "holidays" 
    * Arguments form the jollyday hierarchy of holidays.  e.g. "us:nyc" would be holidays for New York City, USA
    * If none is specified, it will choose based on locale.
    * Countries supported are those supported in [jollyday](https://github.com/svendiedrichsen/jollyday/tree/master/src/main/resources/holidays)
    * Example: `holiday:us:nyc` would be the holidays of New York City, USA
    * Example: `holiday:hu` would be the holidays of Hungary
     
**Examples**

Assume these are executed at noon.
* A 1 hour window for the past 8 'current day of the week'
  * <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">1 hour window</span></a> <a href="#Skip_distance"><span style="color:green">every 24 hours</span></a> <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">from 56 days ago</span></a> <a href="#InclusionExclusion_specifiers"><span style="color:purple">including this day of the week</span></a>
* A 1 hour window for the past 8 tuesdays
  * <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">1 hour window</span></a> <a href="#Skip_distance"><span style="color:green">every 24 hours</span></a> <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">from 56 days ago</span></a> <a href="#InclusionExclusion_specifiers"><span style="color:purple">including tuesdays</span></a>
* A 30 minute window every tuesday at noon starting 14 days ago until now
  * <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">30 minute window</span></a> <a href="#Skip_distance"><span style="color:green">every 24 hours</span></a> <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">from 14 days ago</span></a> <a href="#InclusionExclusion_specifiers"><span style="color:purple">including tuesdays</span></a>
* A 30 minute window every day except holidays and weekends at noon starting 14 days ago until now
  * <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">30 minute window</span></a> <a href="#Skip_distance"><span style="color:green">every 24 hours</span></a> <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">from 14 days ago</span></a> <a href="#InclusionExclusion_specifiers"><span style="color:purple">excluding holidays:us, weekends</span></a>
  * <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">30 minute window</span></a> <a href="#Skip_distance"><span style="color:green">every 24 hours</span></a> <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">from 14 days ago</span></a> <a href="#InclusionExclusion_specifiers"><span style="color:purple">including weekdays excluding holidays:us, weekends</span></a>
* A 30 minute window at noon every day from 7 days ago including saturdays and excluding weekends. 
Because exclusions trump inclusions, the following will never yield any windows
  * <a href="#Temporal_Window_Width"><span style="color:red">30 minute window</span></a> <a href="#Skip_distance"><span style="color:green">every 24 hours</span></a> <a href="#Total_Temporal_Duration"><span style="color:blue">from 7 days ago</span></a> <a href="#InclusionExclusion_specifiers"><span style="color:purple">including saturdays excluding weekends</span></a>

### Errors
The most common result of incorrect `PROFILE_GET` arguments or Client configuration parameters is an empty result set, rather than an error.
The Client cannot effectively validate the arguments, because the Profiler configuration parameters may be changed and the profile itself does not store them.
The person doing the querying must carry forward the knowledge of the Profiler configuration parameters from the time of profile creation, and use corresponding `PROFILE_GET` arguments and Client configuration parameters when querying the data.

### Examples

The following are usage examples that show how the Stellar API can be used to read profiles generated by the [Metron Profiler](../metron-profiler).  This API would be used in conjunction with other Stellar functions like [`MAAS_MODEL_APPLY`](../../metron-platform/metron-common#maas_model_apply) to perform model scoring on streaming data.

These examples assume a profile has been defined called 'snort-alerts' that tracks the number of Snort alerts associated with an IP address over time.  The profile definition might look similar to the following.

```
{
  "profiles": [
    {
      "profile": "snort-alerts",
      "foreach": "ip_src_addr",
      "onlyif":  "source.type == 'snort'",
      "update":  { "s": "STATS_ADD(s, 1)" },
      "result":  "STATS_MEAN(s)"
    }
  ]
}
```

During model scoring the entity being scored, in this case a particular IP address, will be known.  The following examples shows how this profile data might be retrieved.
Retrieve all values of 'snort-alerts' from '10.0.0.1' over the past 4 hours.
```
PROFILE_GET('snort-alerts', '10.0.0.1', PROFILE_FIXED(4, 'HOURS'))
```

Retrieve all values of 'snort-alerts' from '10.0.0.1' over the past 2 days.
```
PROFILE_GET('snort-alerts', '10.0.0.1', PROFILE_FIXED(2, 'DAYS'))
```

If the profile had been defined to group the data by weekday versus weekend, then the following example would apply:

Retrieve all values of 'snort-alerts' from '10.0.0.1' that occurred on 'weekdays' over the past 30 days.
```
PROFILE_GET('snort-alerts', '10.0.0.1', PROFILE_FIXED(30, 'DAYS'), ['weekdays'] )
```

The client may need to use a configuration different from the current Client configuration settings.  For example, perhaps you are on a cluster shared with other analysts, and need to access a profile that was constructed 2 months ago using different period duration, while they are accessing more recent profiles constructed with the currently configured period duration.  For this situation, you may use the `config_overrides` argument:

Retrieve all values of 'snort-alerts' from '10.0.0.1' over the past 2 days, with no `groupBy`, and overriding the usual global client configuration parameters for window duration.
```
PROFILE_GET('profile1', 'entity1', PROFILE_FIXED(2, 'DAYS', {'profiler.client.period.duration' : '2', 'profiler.client.period.duration.units' : 'MINUTES'}), [])
```

Retrieve all values of 'snort-alerts' from '10.0.0.1' that occurred on 'weekdays' over the past 30 days, overriding the usual global client configuration parameters for window duration.
```
PROFILE_GET('profile1', 'entity1', PROFILE_FIXED(30, 'DAYS', {'profiler.client.period.duration' : '2', 'profiler.client.period.duration.units' : 'MINUTES'}), ['weekdays'] )
```


## Getting Started

These instructions step through the process of using the Stellar Client API on a live cluster.  These instructions assume that the 'Getting Started' instructions included with the [Metron Profiler](../metron-profiler) have been followed.  This will create a Profile called 'test' whose data will be retrieved with the Stellar Client API.

To validate that everything is working, login to the server hosting Metron.  We will use the Stellar Shell to replicate the execution environment of Stellar running in a Storm topology, like Metron's Parser or Enrichment topology.  Replace 'node1:2181' with the URL to a Zookeeper Broker.  

```

[Stellar]>>> ?PROFILE_GET
Functions loaded, you may refer to functions now...
PROFILE_GET
Description: Retrieves a series of values from a stored profile.

Arguments:
	profile - The name of the profile.
	entity - The name of the entity.
	durationAgo - How long ago should values be retrieved from?
	units - The units of 'durationAgo'.
	groups_list - Optional, must correspond to the 'groupBy' list used in profile creation - List (in square brackets) of 
            groupBy values used to filter the profile. Default is the empty list, meaning groupBy was not used when 
            creating the profile.
	config_overrides - Optional - Map (in curly braces) of name:value pairs, each overriding the global config parameter
            of the same name. Default is the empty Map, meaning no overrides.

Returns: The selected profile measurements.

[Stellar]>>> PROFILE_GET('test','192.168.138.158', 1, 'HOURS')
[12078.0, 8921.0, 12131.0]
```

The client API call above has retrieved the past hour of the 'test' profile for the entity '192.168.138.158'.
