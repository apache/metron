I am very pleased to announce that the Podling Project Management
Committee (PPMC) of Apache Metron has asked Debo Dutta to become an
Apache Metron committer, and he has already accepted.

Debo has already made many contributions to Metron community, working
on getting a software grant from Cisco and creating a first version of
the Metron website.

Please join me to welcome Debo.
